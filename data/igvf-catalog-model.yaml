# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Biolink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Biolink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Biolink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.

# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

      Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically
      (though not in all cases), and is weaker than its child, 'correlated with', but stronger than its parent,
      'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical 
      dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial 
      Infarction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient 
      will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to 
      the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an 
      Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).

      Instead, use the appropriate biolink class. For example, for the GO concept of endocytosis (GO:0006897),
      use bl:BiologicalProcess as the type.

        This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
        node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category, such as AnatomicalEntity
        (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI or CHEMBL), etc
      - >-
        Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
        but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had a node in the graph representing
        a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample,
        and by typed more specifically with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity
